cs551 System Programming courseworkâ€”implementing "parallel sort" via POSIX pipe.

The idea is to practice Inter Process Communication (IPC) via syscall `pipe`, `fork` and `execl` by writing a CLI program. There will be one parser process that takes `stdin` and writes to pipes connected with sorter processes newline-terminated words. Sorters run `/usr/bin/sort` and writes the output to pipes connected with a merger process, which then outputs to `stdout` frequency of words, sorted.

## files
See "pipe-sort.pdf" for what the coursework is about.

`pipesort-4-10-sh` shows pipelines using POSIX shell utilities to achieve similar results, as running `./pipesort -s 4 -l 10`. It is not part of the homework.

## build instructions
Type `make` in a shell for generating the executable "pipesort". Type `make clean` to get rid of it.

## Questions
- why does my program work without my knowledge that there are Unicode characters present in the test file `test_files/large`? I used `fgetc` to read a `char` from `stdin` in parser process.
- utilizing `pv(1)`, I observed that throughput greatly increased with `-n 8`, i.e. number of sorter processes is 8. I guess the reason is that this is the point where my OS utilizes multicore and finally the effect of parallelism shows up. This leads me to the idea that this can implement parallel sort, which Java has API for in `java.util.Arrays.parallelSort` vs `java.util.Arrays.sort`.
